# InstantGraham

> Social network based off of Instagram

This is a FullStack React Application, utilizing Hasura and GraphQL. The goal was to create an Instagram clone that had as much functionality as the real deal, while also getting more comfortable with some new and interesting technologies. The primary tech used for this project is React, styled with Material-UI, backend is GraphQL hosted on Hasura. The app is hosted on Vercel, which is my favorite right now.
